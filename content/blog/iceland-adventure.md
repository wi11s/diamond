# Iceland Adventure: Chasing Northern Lights and Waterfalls

Iceland has always been at the top of my photography bucket list, and last month I finally made the journey to this incredible Nordic island. What I discovered was beyond anything I could have imagined.

## Planning the Perfect Shot

Preparing for Iceland required more than just packing extra batteries (though the cold definitely drained them faster than usual). I spent weeks studying weather patterns, aurora forecasts, and mapping out the most photogenic locations along the famous Ring Road.

### Essential Gear for Iceland

- **Sturdy tripod** - Absolutely crucial for long exposures and aurora photography
- **Extra batteries** - The cold weather is brutal on battery life
- **Lens hoods and cleaning cloths** - Protecting gear from the constant spray of waterfalls
- **Warm, waterproof clothing** - You can't get the shot if you're too cold to hold the camera

## The Waterfalls

Iceland's waterfalls are absolutely spectacular. Each one has its own personality and photographic challenges:

**Gullfoss** - The "Golden Falls" lived up to its name, especially during the brief golden hour when the winter sun painted everything in warm tones.

**Skógafoss** - Standing at the base of this 60-meter giant, feeling the mist on my face while composing shots, was an unforgettable experience.

**Seljalandsfoss** - The unique opportunity to walk behind this waterfall offered perspectives I'd never experienced before.

## Aurora Photography

The Northern Lights were the holy grail of this trip. After three cloudy nights, the aurora finally appeared on my fourth evening near Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon.

### Aurora Photography Tips

1. **Scout locations during daylight** - You need to know your composition before it gets dark
2. **Use manual focus** - Autofocus struggles in low light
3. **Start with ISO 1600, f/2.8, 8-second exposures** - Adjust from there
4. **Be patient** - The aurora can change intensity quickly

## The Glacier Lagoon

Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon was perhaps the most surreal location I've ever photographed. Massive icebergs floating in a pristine lagoon, with seals occasionally popping up to say hello. The nearby Diamond Beach, where icebergs wash up on black volcanic sand, created some of my favorite compositions of the entire trip.

## Lessons Learned

This trip taught me that sometimes the best shots come when you least expect them. While I had planned many compositions, some of my favorite images were captured during unexpected moments - a sudden break in the clouds, the way light reflected off an iceberg, or the perfect silence of a snow-covered landscape.

Iceland reminded me why I fell in love with photography in the first place. It's not just about the technical aspects or the perfect settings - it's about being present in these incredible moments and having the privilege to share them with others.

## Next Adventure

Already planning my return trip for summer to capture the midnight sun and explore the highland roads that are inaccessible in winter. Iceland, I'll be back!
